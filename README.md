## The Forest

		"Those who wish to pass close to the edge will be forbidden by the Snorphs," read the manager for the local village.
	"...and finally, those who stray from the path will be captured and relocated outside of the village grounds. Does everyone understand this and solumnly swear
	under the threat of denial and banishment from the village that you will abide by these rules for the duration of your stay at the village?"
	"Aye!" proclaimed the research group.
	"Very well then, we shall start the walk later tomorrow morning. I expect every one of you to be prepared for the long journey ahead. Carry on now, explore the 
	village and it's facinating enterntainment pieces."
